Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

 Tools Used
- **Password Strength Checker: [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)
- Browser: Chrome (any modern browser works)

 Steps Followed
1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity.
2. Used uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and different lengths.
3. Tested each password using an online password strength checker.
4. Collected scores and feedback from the tool.
5. Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.
6. Noted tips and recommendations based on the evaluation.
7. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
8. Summarized how password complexity impacts security.

Password Evaluation Results

| Password              | Length | Uppercase | Lowercase | Numbers | Symbols | Strength (Tool) | Estimated Crack Time |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Golu1234             | 8      | yes       | Yes       | Yes     | No      | Weak            | minutes             |

Key Observations
- Short passwords are easier to crack.
- Adding symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters increases complexity.
- Longer, mixed-character passwords are exponentially harder to break.

 Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
1. Use 12â€“16+ characters.
2. Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. Avoid dictionary words and personal information.
4. Use passphrases for better memorization.
5. Do not reuse passwords across multiple platforms.

Common Password Attacks
- Brute Force: Attempts every possible combination.
- Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common words/phrases.
- Phishing: Tricks users into revealing credentials.
- Keylogging: Records keystrokes to capture passwords.

 Conclusion
Password complexity directly affects security. Strong passwords significantly reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect sensitive data.
